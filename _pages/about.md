👩‍🎓I’m a passionate Data Engineer and recent ENSAI graduate, specialised in Big Data and Data Engineering, with a Bachelor's in Statistics and Business Intelligence. During my internships, I’ve built innovative, data-driven solutions that tackle complex business challenges. I thrive on designing cutting-edge decision-making tools for executive teams and am at my best in dynamic, multicultural environments.

<!--🌱 Drawing on my diverse experience, I am committed to using data to create positive social and environmental impact.-->

<!--💻 Now working as a Data Engineer, I am committed to using data to drive impactful outcomes for organisations and society alike.-->

As a passionate music enthusiast, I'm always on the hunt for new melodies and rhythms ; I'm currently developing a [music quiz](https://github.com/alannadevgen/quizzify) application! This project aims to create an experience for users by generating quizzes based on their Spotify listening history. Leveraging the power of the Spotify API and the FastAPI framework, this app is designed to be both fun and interactive. Stay tuned for updates and prepare to test your musical knowledge like never before!

By the way, here's a glimpse of the song I'm currently enjoying:

**🚀 Hi, I’m Alanna**, I'm a passionate **Data Engineer based in Paris**, currently building robust data pipelines at LittleBigCode and proudly certified as a **Google Cloud Professional Data Engineer** (2024).

With a master’s from ENSAI (2023) and hands‑on expertise in Python, SQL, Java/Scala, Docker/Kubernetes, FastAPI, and cloud-native tools like ArgoCD and Tekton, I thrive on transforming complex data into scalable, production-grade systems.

What sets me apart?

* **End-to-end deployment**: from data modeling and ingestion to real-time monitoring using Prometheus/Grafana
* **Cloud-first mindset**: architecting resilient pipeline solutions on GCP
* **Agile & collaborative spirit**: thriving in dynamic teams and constantly iterating for impact

[//]: # (**Recently**, I led the design of a Spotify-based music quiz using FastAPI—showcasing my ability to blend user-centric apps with data-driven logic.)


**🎯 If you're looking for someone who can build scalable data systems, bridge the gap between development and analytics, and bring a dose of innovative energy—I'm your person.**

Let’s connect! I’d love to explore how I can help drive your next data project forward.
