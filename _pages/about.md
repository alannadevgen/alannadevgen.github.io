👩‍🎓I’m a passionate Data Engineer and recent ENSAI graduate, specialised in Big Data and Data Engineering, with a Bachelor's in Statistics and Business Intelligence.

I thrive on designing cutting-edge decision-making tools for executive teams and am at my best in dynamic, multicultural environments.

🌱 Drawing on my diverse experience, I am committed to using data to create positive social and environmental impact.
